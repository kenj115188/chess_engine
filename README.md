# chess_engine
This is a project that I am doing for learning python. It is a cli chess game, capable of doing legal moves, keeping track of the status of the board and calculate a response.
It is in development so many components are not yet functional.
Please give me feedback on the code, I will appreciate it!
I am planning to add MinMax and alfa/beta algorithms.
